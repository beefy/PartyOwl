            <p>This is a small app for Windows, iOS, and Android. It was developed with Apache Cordova and used Phoneblocks in publishing. The app itself is only two simple modes, and the only difference is a changing background color and a spinning image. To learn about setting up a simple multiplatform Cordova app, or to contribute to this project, you can clone the project as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git clone https://github.com/nschultz14/PartyOwl.git
</code></pre>

            <div id="storediv">
                <p>The app is avaiable for download here:</p>

            <p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

            </h3>

            <p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
